                        <p className="mt-8 text-white text-justify px-16">Speech and swallowing difficulties are common in Parkinson's disease. Speech
                            therapy, also known as speech-language pathology, can help individuals with PD improve speech
                            clarity, volume, and articulation. Swallowing therapy, known as dysphagia therapy, focuses on
                            strengthening the muscles involved in swallowing and addressing swallowing difficulties. These
                            therapies aim to enhance communication and ensure proper nutrition and hydration for individuals
                            with Parkinson's disease.
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Speech therapy sessions may include exercises to improve breath control, vocal strength, and
                                    coordination of speech muscles, enabling clearer and more intelligible speech for
                                    individuals with PD.</li>
                                <li>2. Swallowing therapy techniques involve exercises and strategies to improve swallowing
                                    function, reduce the risk of aspiration, and ensure safe and efficient swallowing.</li>
                                <li>3. Speech-language pathologists may use communication strategies and techniques to compensate
                                    for speech difficulties, such as using visual cues or augmentative and alternative
                                    communication (AAC) devices.</li>
                                <li>4. Swallowing therapy may include texture modification of food and liquids to accommodate
                                    swallowing difficulties and prevent choking or aspiration.</li>
                                <li>5. Speech and swallowing therapy can help individuals with Parkinson's disease maintain oral
                                    health, prevent weight loss, and ensure adequate nutrition and hydration.</li>
